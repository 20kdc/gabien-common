# Media

Originally, these were media components of USLX, split out because USLX shouldn't have them.

However, atlas/PVA code has to go here so that UI can remain _just_ UI stuff.

Besides, images are media too, and that generally should have good coordination with engine.

For that reason, some code may get thrown back in USLX.
