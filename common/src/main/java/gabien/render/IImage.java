/**
 * An image. All IImages that are not IGrDrivers must be immutable.
 * In theory, this was created on 11/08/17.
 * In practice, this was an inner interface of IGraphicsDriver back in the very beginning.
 * The earliest version on record is from August 3rd, 2014.
 * By the end of 2016, which was when R48 started, it was still part of IGrInDriver.
 * R48 0.7.1 finally separated out the interface. (The class compile date is August 11th, 2017.)
 * IAWTImageLike was introduced sometime around June 9th, 2017.
 * It then became INativeImageHolder sometime around August 21st, 2017.
 * On the 7th June, 2023, it became IVopeksSurfaceHolder.
 * Now it's 9th June 2023. Vopeks is pretty much certain; we're not going back, so everything was merged.
 * 9th July 2023: Made into an abstract class.
