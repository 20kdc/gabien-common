# minimp3 modified

This will at some point contain a modified copy of https://github.com/lieff/minimp3/ !

Specific planned modifications are:

* Support for GaBIEn's kinda-cursed cross-compilation system
* Whatever I have to do to make it capable of measuring a stream without fully decoding it
* Stripping out anything I don't need (particularly stdio will receive this treatment)

However, this hasn't been started *yet.* Terrible bout of laziness, I know.
